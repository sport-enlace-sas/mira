  <strong>Self-hosted AI code review. Your code, your dashboard, your LLM key.</strong>
</p>

> **Inlaze corporate fork.** This repository combines the self-hosted review

> deterministic delegation interface from
> [Alibaba OpenCodeReview](https://github.com/alibaba/open-code-review).
> Mira owns the GitHub App, dashboard, durable jobs, policy, publishing and
> Claude Code → Codex fallback. OpenCodeReview is consumed as a pinned binary
> that selects reviewable files and path-targeted rules; its source is neither
> copied nor modified here. See [third-party notices](THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md).

## Corporate review chain

```
OpenCodeReview (deterministic plan) → Claude Code → Codex fallback → Mira → GitHub
```

For the Inlaze deployment, OCR receives only an ephemeral, detached checkout
of the base and head SHA. It cannot run repository hooks, submodules, project
scripts, plugins or MCP servers. Its JSON plan is passed to Mira as context;
the configured LLM providers remain the only components that reason about
findings. If OCR is unavailable or returns invalid data, Mira records a
degraded scope and uses its native planner rather than silently dropping a PR.

The exact OCR revision is tracked in
[`third_party/open-code-review.lock`](third_party/open-code-review.lock).
Update Mira or OCR only through a reviewed PR, including the compatibility and
Docker test suites.

</p>

Self-host every feature: full review engine, codebase indexing, vulnerability scanning, custom rules, org-wide package search, dashboard, learning loop. No paid tier, no license key, no SaaS upsell.

Mira reviews your pull requests using your choice of LLM (via [OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai), which fronts Anthropic, OpenAI, Google, DeepSeek, and more) and posts concise, actionable feedback. The noise filter, confidence clamping, and learning loop ensure you only see comments that matter. See [`FEATURES.md`](FEATURES.md) for the full surface.

## Why Teams Choose Mira

- **Model agnostic** — Run Claude, GPT, Gemini, DeepSeek, Llama, or any OpenAI-compatible endpoint: OpenRouter, vLLM, Ollama, Together, Groq, Fireworks, or AWS Bedrock direct. Per-provider quirks are config, not code, so adding a provider is a one-line entry.
- **Zero markup on LLM costs** — Bring your own key. You pay the model provider directly; Mira never proxies your spend or adds a multiplier. The dashboard shows real per-repo, per-model cost — not estimates.
- **Learns from your context** — Mira synthesizes rules from your merged PRs: rejected comments and human review patterns become team rules that shape future reviews.
- **You set the rules** — Define custom and org-wide review rules in plain language, per-repo via `.mira.yaml` or from the dashboard.
- **Privacy first** — Self-hosted by default. Diffs, indexes, review history, and CVE data live in your SQLite or Postgres, on infra you own. No phone-home, no required telemetry, no "is this used for training?"
- **Low-noise reviews** — Confidence thresholds, dedup, a self-critique pass, and per-PR caps mean every comment is one worth reading — and Mira is the fastest tool on the public [Code Review Bench](#benchmark).
- **Catches PRs stepping on each other** — While reviewing, Mira checks the repo's other open PRs and flags merge-conflict risk and duplicate effort right in the walkthrough.
- **Indexed, cross-file context** — A full-repo code index gives the model real project context, not just the diff — plus org-wide package search and hourly OSV.dev CVE scanning across every repo.
- **GitHub, GitLab, and Forgejo** — Auto-reviews every PR and merge request and answers `@miracodeai` questions inline, with full feature parity across GitHub, GitLab, and Forgejo (incl. Codeberg). A Bitbucket adapter is next; the engine, indexer, and dashboard are provider-agnostic, so a new host is a data entry plus one provider class.
- **Self-host on day one** — Docker image with Railway / Fly.io / Render configs, SQLite or Postgres. Every feature included.

## Dashboard

![Mira dashboard](.github/assets/Dashboard.png)

## Your data, your dashboard

Most AI reviewers are SaaS: your diffs (and often the full surrounding code) leave for a third-party server, and the only "view" you get is the comments that come back on a PR. Mira flips both halves of that:

- **Your code never leaves your infra.** Diffs, embeddings, indexes, review history, vulnerability data, all stored in your SQLite or Postgres, on infrastructure you own. No phone-home, no required telemetry, no "is this used for training?" question.
- **The dashboard you see above is yours.** It's not a marketing screenshot of someone else's view of your code. CodeRabbit, Greptile, and similar SaaS reviewers don't expose anything like it. Mira's dashboard surfaces signals you don't get anywhere else:
  - **Org-wide package inventory**: answer "which repos use `lodash@4.17.20`?" in one query. Stack it next to your CVE feed for instant blast-radius checks.
  - **CVE alerts on every dependency**: hourly OSV.dev poll, severity + advisory link + fix version surfaced inline next to the package.
  - **Dependency + blast-radius graphs**: see exactly which files and repos depend on a symbol before you change it.
  - **Per-repo review event stream**: every webhook, every chunk, every cost figure, in one place for live troubleshooting.
  - **Cost & token telemetry**: actual spend per repo and per model, not estimates, because you control the LLM key.
  - **Review-health page**: stale/waiting PRs, a reviewer-responsiveness leaderboard, throughput trends, and rubber-stamp detection (approvals with no substantive review) — plus per-contributor analytics with a year-long heatmap and Mira's review-quality signal.
  - **Coming soon, change-frequency heatmaps**: surface the files that bug fixes keep landing on so you can target review attention.

If your engineering team needs answers like *"which of our repos are exposed to this CVE?"* or *"what's the blast radius of changing this function?"*, those questions stop being multi-day investigations and start being one-click dashboard pages.

## Benchmark

Mira is **the fastest tool measured** on the public [Code Review Bench](https://codereview.withmartian.com/?mode=offline), and the only one on the speed/quality Pareto frontier: every tool that scores higher on F1 takes **5–14× longer per PR**.

![Median review time per PR, Mira vs every published competitor](.github/assets/benchmark-frontier.svg)

Plotted against every published competitor on the same subset, Mira sits in the upper-left corner: everything to the right is slower; everything above it pays 5–14× the wall time for the extra F1.

![Speed vs quality: Mira on the Pareto frontier](.github/assets/benchmark-by-language.svg)

Measured on the same 50-PR offline benchmark, judged by Claude Sonnet 4.6.

| | **Mira** | Cubic-v2 | Greptile | CodeRabbit | GitHub Copilot |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| F1 | **44** | 56 | 35 | 32 | 31 |
| Precision | **43%** | 50% | 32% | 24% | 24% |

## Quick Start

Run Mira self-hosted to auto-review every PR and merge request and answer `@miracodeai` questions inline. GitHub (as a GitHub App), GitLab (via a group/project access token), and Forgejo/Codeberg (via an access token) are all fully supported; Bitbucket is next.

**1. Deploy** — one-click on Railway, or with Docker:

[![Deploy on Railway](https://railway.com/button.svg)](https://railway.com/workspace/templates/05874bad-2d98-43f4-aa93-332f394e9ebd)

```yaml
# mira.yaml — deployment-wide defaults. Every key is optional.
llm:
  model: "anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-6"
  indexing_model: "anthropic/claude-haiku-4-5"
```

```bash
# .env — secrets only.
MIRA_GITHUB_APP_ID=123456
MIRA_GITHUB_PRIVATE_KEY="$(cat private-key.pem)"
MIRA_WEBHOOK_SECRET=your-secret
OPENROUTER_API_KEY=sk-or-...
```

```bash
docker run -p 8000:8000 --env-file .env \
  -v "$(pwd)/mira.yaml:/app/mira.yaml" \
  ghcr.io/miracodeai/mira:latest --config /app/mira.yaml
```

**2. Install the app** on your repos — every PR gets reviewed.

### Codex CLI

If you already use OpenAI Codex locally, Mira can run reviews through the
Codex CLI instead of an HTTP API key. Authentication stays inside Codex via
`CODEX_HOME/auth.json`, created by `codex login`:

```yaml
# mira.yaml
llm:
  provider: "codex-cli"
  model: "codex-default"      # use the Codex CLI default model
  codex_home: "/run/codex"    # optional; defaults to CODEX_HOME
  codex_sandbox: "read-only"  # the only accepted sandbox policy
  codex_timeout_seconds: 900  # optional
```

The official Mira image includes a pinned Codex CLI. Mount a Codex login read-only:

```bash
docker run -p 8000:8000 --env-file .env \
  -e CODEX_HOME=/run/codex \
  -v "$HOME/.codex:/run/codex:ro" \
  -v "$(pwd)/mira.yaml:/app/mira.yaml:ro" \
  ghcr.io/miracodeai/mira:latest --config /app/mira.yaml
```

This provider does not require `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`. Mira copies only `auth.json`
from the read-only mount into a private, writable temporary Codex home for each
invocation. It launches Codex in an empty temporary workspace with a minimal
environment, disables inherited shell environment variables and user/project
rules, and enforces the read-only sandbox.
Provider choice, executable/auth paths, sandbox policy, and timeout are
deployment-only settings; repository `.mira.yaml` files cannot override them.
For one-shot `mira review` runs, `--config` is treated as untrusted by default.
An operator-owned config may opt in with `--trust-execution-settings`; never use
that flag with a repository-controlled file.

Codex CLI does not expose Mira's temperature or hard output-token controls, so
Mira disables ensemble sampling for this provider. The mounted OAuth session is
still a sensitive deployment credential: use a dedicated Codex account/session
and isolate the Mira container from unrelated host files and services.

## Configuration

`mira.yaml` (loaded via `--config`) holds deployment-wide defaults. Drop a `.mira.yaml` in any repo — or use the dashboard — to override per-repo; both deep-merge over `mira.yaml` for that repo only:

```yaml
# .mira.yaml — optional per-repo override
filter:
  confidence_threshold: 0.5  # noisier repo → lower bar
  max_comments: 10
```
